# Bamazon-CLI

Bamazon is a command line interface for tracking inventory and sales. It has a customer file
that allows customers to make purchases based on item ID numbers. When a customer makes a purchase
the inventory is removed from the database. If their is not enough inventory to fulfill the desired order
the customer is alerted and the order is not placed.
